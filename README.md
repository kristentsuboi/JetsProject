# JetsProject

# Overview
This program loads in a fleet of jets from a text file. It then prompts a menu allowing the user to list all jets, fly all jets, view the fastest jet, view the jet with the longest range, load cargo jets, fight figher jets, add a jet to the fleet, or remove a jet from the fleet.

# Technologies Used
-OOP
-Superclass with subclasses and interfaces
-If statements that determine which method to call.
-Scanner for user input
-Abstract classes



# Lessons Learned
When building this program, I used the UML provided as a base and wrote out my tasks and where they needed to take place. I then wrote the program piece by piece debugging as I go. At the end, I cleaned the code up and created methods for organizational purposes. This project definitely boosted my confidence in OOP and allowed me to feel more comfortable with inheritance and interfaces and the relationships amongst the objects I created.
